# Code Convention
## üì¢ Working Language
- Use `English` 100% when working: `variable names`, `code comments`, `commit messages` ...

## üéØ Code Convention  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Project Structure**  
- **components/**: Contains reusable components:
  + Each component should have its own folder. For example: `Button.jsx`.
  + Each component folder should have an `index.jsx` file to export the main component.
- **pages/**: Contains the main pages of the application, each page should have its own folder containing files like: `.jsx`, `.scss`, and `index.jsx`  
- **hooks/**: Contains custom hooks, each hook should have its own file and be named according to the `useSomething.js` convention.  
- **utils/**: Contains utility functions, each function should have its own file and be named according to the `somethingUtils.js` convention.  
- **services/**: Contains API requests, each service should have its own file and be named according to the `somethingService.js` convention.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Naming Conventions**

- Variables and functions use **camelCase** (`fetchUserData`)
- Components use **PascalCase** (`UserProfile`)
- Constants and action types use **UPPER_CASE** (`API_URL`)
- Component file names use **PascalCase** (`UserProfile.js`)
- Helper functions use **camelCase** (`formatDate.js`)
- Folders use **kebab-case** (`user-profile/`)
- CSS classes use **kebab-case** (`header-container`)
- Custom hooks start with "use" (`useAuth`)
- API instances use **PascalCase** (`ApiClient`)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Code Writing Rules**
- Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** to ensure code quality
- Follow **React JSX Syntax** standards
- Use **PascalCase** for component file names (`HeaderComponent.js`)
- Variables and functions use **camelCase** (`fetchUserData`)
- Use **async/await** instead of `.then().catch()` 

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **CSS Writing Rules**  
- Use **TailwindCSS** for most styling  
- Avoid writing `inline-style` directly in JSX  
- If custom CSS is needed, use a separate `.scss` file  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Commit Rules**  
- Use the standard format: `type(scope): message`  
- Common commit types:  
  + `feat`: New feature  
  + `fix`: Bug fix  
  + `refactor`: Code improvement  
  + `style`: Style changes that do not affect logic  
  + `docs`: Documentation updates
